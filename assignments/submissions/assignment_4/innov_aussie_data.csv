Always put the customers first and treat everybody... customers, suppliers and staff  respectfully.

Initially we chose Fairfield as our base because of its close proximity to government accommodation housing new Australians at that time.  We serviced the aspirations of many different people and cultures.

As the migrants, our customers moved further afield, so did Bing Lee. Like all new Australians, we quickly became part of the colourful fabric of Australia.

Over time our range of electrical products grew with increasing speed. For some reason, perhaps due to our heritage, we were quick to adapt to new technologies and new products quicker than most. Our customers always want the latest gadgets and were always prepared to stock the latest technology.

We are now excited to be able to take our Bing Lee philosophy online with the launch of our new website. Youll be able to browse, learn, compare and shop from the convenience of your own home with the knowledge that we are just a click or a phone call away if you need us.

Sadly, both Bing (1987) and Ken (2007) are no longer with us. However with my two sons, Lionel and Greg, plus a wonderful team of dedicated people, we continue to run Bing Lee as a family business. The principles with which we established the business all those years ago remain as important today as they did back then.

Recent times have seen an expansion and improvement within the Tynan Motor Group. Our vision of superior customer service as a principal component to our ongoing success, has never been clearer. We pride ourselves on the marketing of products and services and see this activity as central to our continued success and expansion.

The latest addition to our expansion plans is a brand new Subaru showroom at Sutherland. The stunning new venue is the perfect place to showcase one of Australia's fastest growing automotive brands. More and more Australians are discovering the advantages of all-wheel drive, and the new Tynan showroom is the ideal place to feature Subaru's renowned quality, performance and style. Speaking of style, work has been completed on our multi-million dollar new home for our Mercedes dealership. The new home of Mercedes in the south is taking up six additional building blocks and 40% of the existing property. Mercedes Auto Haus is one of the most modern and innovative dealerships of its type in Australia.

The Tynan Motor Group endeavours to achieve world-class standards in all aspects of our business. Every year we send several company representatives to the NADA automotive conference held in the United States to further strengthen our competitive advantage. As Michael Tynan explains: ""The large investment in sending staff to the US is always worth it. They return to Australia with fresh ideas and a fresh perspective. Yet most importantly, they have learned through personal experience and return with ideas that they can put straight into action.""

Michael's policy on staff development is simple, ""I think it's important to encourage further staff development through both broad and specific education for our management team and support staff. This ensures everyone understands and appreciates their professional role in the automotive industry"".

Community involvement has a high priority within the Tynan Motor Group, and it has always been a company policy to encourage staff to join local organisations and community groups. As such, Tynan Motors sponsors several sporting, cultural and health organisations throughout the St George and Sutherland Shire. The company is extremely conscious of performing a genuine role within the community, as a responsible and caring corporate citizen. The company philosophy is that it must continue to grow within its financial and human resources.

""Understanding the market requires diligence and being constantly involved, learning, educating and involving our staff in all aspects of the business. The Tynan family's involvement ensures a strong future as we embrace change and plan our future growth.""

Technology

Quikticket
Quikticket is a web based ticketing system which allows users to retrieve PNRs directly from their PCC and issue tickets. It contains a mass of behind the scene fares, CRS and ticketing logic to make the process as simple, streamlined and efficient as possible for the user. This system talks to Sabre, Galileo and Amadeus CRS systems as well Quikfares Agency profile and ticketing databases. 

Quikfares
This is a web based fare search engine where users can check what fares are currently available by specifying at minimum the origin, destination and departure date. Fares are updated during normal business hours by the National Fares Department located in the Sydney office. 

Quikfares Portal

A potential passenger can search for Quikfares from within the agent's website and incorporate the agent's mark up amounts. A request for a booking is then emailed along with the details of the passenger and their preferred itinerary to the agent. The agent has the ability to manage the colour schemes and mark ups to apply to their portal. 

Quikfares Export
Quikfares Export is an ongoing automatic XML feed of Quikfares to the Amadeus Negotiated (Nego) contract system. This unique Australian exclusive service allows an agent to search for Quikfares within the Amadeus environment (usually catering for online booking engine providers such as Expedia). Fares are uploaded very frequently as changes are implemented by the National Fares Department during normal business hours. This unique access to highly competitive net remit fares empowers online booking engine providers with an edge over the competition. 

Quikinsurance
Quikinsurance is a high yield, ground breaking and exclusive travel insurance product. It offers a broad range of products at competitive rates and is supported by QBE's in house Emergency Assistance Service.

and has been for over 50 years.

Company Story
The beginnings of PFD Food Services date back to 1864, when J Hill & Son commenced business as a fresh fish merchant, operating from the Melbourne wholesale fish markets.

In 1943, J Hill's directors were finding it increasingly difficult to operate within the government's restrictive pricing control policy, so decided to form a company that sold processed fish, which was not liable to price control. It was then that Processed Fish Distributors (PFD) began supplying shark and whiting fillets, smoked cod and cooked crayfish throughout the metropolitan area and some regional centers. Premises were leased from the Brunswick Ice Works where the processing took place and frozen fish was delivered to the suburbs in vans that were insulated with compressed and trussed straw. PFD's customers in regional areas received their goods by rail.

More information
The War Years

During the years after the war, PFD expanded its product line to include items such as frozen peas, pies and ice cream, virtually halted its fish processing. As the name was no longer representative of the products sold, PFD changed the word 'fish' in its name to 'food'.

One of the new product lines for Processed Food Distributors was the 'Frikkie' fish stick, a finger-sized piece of fish from Irvin & Johnson in South Africa, and the forerunner of the fish finger.

In 1958 the Managing Director of PFD, Frank Hill, retired and sold the business to I&J, which was establishing an Australia-wide network of distribution centers. Albert Martin controlled the two companies J Hill & Son and PFD, for I&J, and over the next two decades the company was a significant player in the food industry.

Joining PFD in 1959 as a salesman/driver at the Morwell branch was Richard Smith who was later to become Managing Director. He was promoted to Head Office in Melbourne as Sales Manager in 1968, and General Manager in 1970. I&J sold PFD to a consortium in 1975 that included Richard Smith and the Liberman family. One of the key objectives of the consortium was to service the rapidly expanding Half-Case stores with dairy and frozen foods.

Requiring new premises from which to operate, PFD used old cool stores in Blackburn until land was purchased in Knoxfield. The new facility commenced operation in 1977 and three years later more than doubled its warehousing space to 6000 pallet spaces. Richard Smith bought out other members of the consortium in 1988. At the same time Glacier Foods Group Pty Ltd was purchased, bringing with it a string of strategically located distribution centres throughout regional Victoria.

Glacier Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd, a 100 percent Australian-owned company, was the corporate vehicle used in the acquisition of PFD and Glacier Foods Group Pty Ltd by Richard Smith. The history of Glacier Foods Group Pty Ltd dates back to 1984 when it was formally established as a collection of branches in Geelong, Bendigo and Echuca, with a head office located in Melbourne. During 1985 additional branches were established at Albury and Warrnambool. Once acquired by Richard Smith through Glacier Holdings (Australia) Pty Ltd on June 30 1988, the Melbourne based head office was consolidated with PFD at Knoxfield.

The future direction and scope of the newly joined group was identified and PFD's name was changed to PFD Food Services Pty Ltd to reflect the new corporate direction.

In 1989 a branch at Shepparton was added and the branch at Echuca sold.

The business of Acton Food Services in Wagga Wagga, NSW was acquired by the group in 1990 providing further geographical diversity to an already diverse customer base.

During 1990, state of the art IBM System 36 computers and purpose-designed software were installed at all branches.

The next major change in direction was the introduction of Dry Goods. In March 1991 the group expanded its product range to cover a full range of Dry Goods. This was in line with the group's new direction of providing a 'One Stop Supply' facility to its customers. During the 1992 financial year, dry goods warehouses and sales facilities were established at the Albury, Bendigo and Geelong branches.

In March 1992 Mac Cocking Pty Ltd, an Adelaide-based food distribution company, was added to the group. Mac Cocking Pty Ltd was acquired from its founder, Mr Malcolm Cocking, who at the age of eighty was looking to retire. Formed in 1951, the company had become a leader in the Food Service industry in South Australia, sharing many common suppliers with Glacier Foods Group. Mac Cocking has always and continues to be a market driven company with a high degree of customer awareness at all levels. Historically, the company has been involved in the wholesale distribution of frozen foods and seafoods and fits in neatly with the remainder of the group's operations.

During the 1993 financial year a branch at Horsham was added to the group and a dry goods warehouse and sales facilities were added at Wagga Wagga.

In addition, the Warrnambool branch was relocated to new expanded premises, and the activities of dry goods wholesaler Western Group Buyers, which were acquired during the year, were merged with the Warrnambool frozen goods business within the new facility.

1995 saw major changes at the Knoxfield premises with the warehouse being extended to more than double its original size and new administration, sales and logistics offices being added.

In November 1995 the group purchased Central Highlands Food Service located in Ballarat and in July 1996 Rochlen Wholesalers in Bega was purchased. March 1997 saw the addition of Allfood Distribution in Tasmania with branches in Hobart, Devonport and Launceston. In September 1997 the company opened a branch in Mildura. The acquisition of these companies increased the group's distribution coverage, and ensured better service for customers.

January 1998 saw the purchase of Nestle Dairy Products' foodservice division which included a branch at Griffith in NSW.

The next major step was taken in November 1998 when PFD purchased Pontes Fruit and Vegetable market in Launceston, Tasmania. This was PFD's first venture into Fruit and Vegetable further enhancing it's reputation as a ""One Stop Shop"" Food Service Distributor.

July 1998 saw PFD achieve HACCP Food Safety Accreditation leading all Food Service Companies throughout Australia, which further enhanced PFD service level to its customers.

In early 1999 PFD purchased Bellmac Foods, located in Narooma and Cooma following this PFD acquired Oceanfresh Distributors in Canberra, its first venture into the nation's capital.

In May 1999 PFD Adelaide purchased Marino's Food Distributors, which was merged into the existing business. Shortly after this PFD opened its newest distribution centre in Morwell.

Batehaven Foods in Batemans Bay was purchased in mid September 1999 followed by Dawes Wholesale Foods based in Canberra in October 1999.

In June 2000 PFD acquired the Foodservice division of Norco. With 13 (thirteen) distribution centres throughout New South Wales and Queensland, making PFD a true eastern seaboard distributor with access to close to 90% of the nation's population. Boland Trading in Dubbo was also acquired and integrated into the PFD Norco Foodservices division.

In August 2000 a depot in Cairns was opened to cover the far north of Queensland and in October PFD purchased Tamworth Foods, Tamworth, New South Wales which forms part of the PFD Norco Foodservices business.

Also in October 2000 saw the relocation of the Auburn branch (NSW) into a modern facility at Blacktown, New South Wales and shortly after PFD acquired the business of Metropolitan Frozen Foods in Sydney.

In December 2000 PFD acquired Sunny Queen Food Services division to strengthen PFD's position in the Queensland market. Sunny Queen had eight distribution centres throughout Queensland and Northern New South Wales.

In July 2001 PFD strengthened coverage on the New South Wales central coast with the purchase of Resort Food Services with branches at Port Macquarie and Taree.

In April 2002 the acquisition of GN Distributors from National Food Milk Ltd strengthened the market position in Adelaide and enhanced coverage in regional South Australia by the addition of branches in Mt Gambier, Port Augusta and Whyalla.

To further strengthen its presence in NSW PFD purchased Chippys Food Distributors which has given the company access to expanded range of fresh fish.

In 2007 the acquisition of Marios in Tasmania and Parkinsons Wholesale in Morwell and South Gippsland Catering Services in Korumburra and Cowes has seen the total number of employees grow to over 2000 and the fleet extend to over 540 vehicles. During the same year they acquired QSC Seafood Wholesalers in Tweed Heads and Johnny Mud Crab in Cairns complementing the range of fresh seafood products already enjoyed by PFD customers.

Now in 2010 with the expansion into Western Australia PFD can now deliver from in the north to Esperance down south. With eight branches in Perth the network across Australia now has 65 branches in total.",your business success be our business and have be for over year company story the beginning of pfd food service

Their son, the energetic and dynamic Deen De Bortoli, (b 1936  d 2003) expanded and consolidated the business created by his parents. Deen's children established De Bortoli's reputation for premium wine including icon dessert wine Noble One and the Yarra Valley wines.

Italian family values passed down from Vittorio remain core values, there is a culture of hard work, generosity of spirit and of sharing good food, good wine and good times with family and friends.

Below is a video of the De Bortoli family taken as part of the Australia's First Families of Wine joint marketing initiative which involves some of Australia's oldest and most respected wine families.

The winemaking philosophy is that great wine begins in the vineyard. The belief is that sustainable vineyard practices will deliver exceptional fruit quality to the winery as well as real environmental benefits.
The focus is on careful site selection, vine maturity and high input viticulture with a move towards biological farming principles. There is also increasing awareness of the importance of single vineyard wines. In the winery minimal interference, allowing the wine to 'make itself' and the mantra it is harder to do nothing encapsulate this belief.

73,/content/drive/My Drive/test1/About/73.txt,"A History Of The Company

When David Waugh and Sydney Josephson established their partnership in an engineering works in the sovereign State of New South Wales they began much more than they could have imagined.

It was soon time for a branch office in Brisbane and Sydney Josephson opened it early in the 1890's. In the meantime new, larger premises had been established in Sussex Street, Sydney. It was here that the partnership carried out much of its engineering work. However, demand continued to grow and larger premises were required. A modern building was erected in Unwins Bridge Road, St. Peters and started operations in 1895. Forethought in the planning at this site is illustrated by the fact that it proved adequate until 1950, serving through the years of World War II for licensed manufacture of Caterpillar No. 12 Motor Graders and other attachments.

Much earlier David Waugh had retired; Sydney Josephson carried on alone and converted the Business into a Limited Liability Company. His sale of a number of Holt track-type tractors was to prove the most significant change affecting the future of Waugh & Josephson. In 1922 as governing director, he passed away suddenly. Great as the loss was, he had established the solid foundation on which the organisation was to grow.

For such times Sydney Josephson was a farsighted man. In 1923, the company was appointed Queensland distributor for the Holt crawler tractor - two years before Daniel Holt and Charles Best were to form the Caterpillar Tractor Co. in the United States. The track-type tractor gained universal acceptance and the company's destiny was set ... together, manufacturer and dealer established in Australia, an unsurpassed record of outstanding quality.

Continuance of family interest was assured when Mrs Josephson, wife of the late Sydney Josephson married Mr M. S. Atwill. ""M.S."" or ""Mick"", two names by which he was later to become affectionately known, soon made valuable contributions to the company progress. He was elected to the Board of Directors in 1930. He became Chairman in 1937 and served in that capacity until his death in 1965. The sons of M. S. Atwill inherited his interests in Waugh & Josephson and, as Board members, they contributed much to company policy and growth. Alan C. Atwill joined the organisation in 1945 following service in the Royal Australian Navy in World War II. He became a director and prior to his retirement in 1973 held the position of Managing Director. Sir John Atwill joined the Board in 1965 following the death of his father and continued to serve in that capacity until 1989.

Waugh & Josephson was taken over in 1987, first by Robert Holmes a Court, and then by the Bond Group, who decided that the Caterpillar dealership interests were a non-core asset which would be divested.

Consequently, during 1988 Caterpillar called for expressions of interest to take on the Dealership for NSW and ACT and subsequently selected Harcourt Gough and Tony Gilmour as their preferred new Dealer. The dealership proposal was based on a culture of customer support. Both were civil engineers with experience in Caterpillar Dealerships. Harcourt Gough had previously been Managing Director of Gough Gough & Hamer in New Zealand and Tony Gilmour had held senior positions in both Waugh & Josephson and Gough Gough & Hamer.

In February 1989, Harcourt Gough & Tony Gilmour successfully concluded negotiations with Bond Corporation to acquire the dealership operations of Waugh & Josephson and hence began Gough & Gilmour's tenure as the Caterpillar Dealer in NSW & ACT, which continued through to 8 April 2004.

Expansion & Growth

In line with their original Business Plan Gough & Gilmour opened a number of new branches around NSW. The strategic directive was to have support as close to the customers as possible. In doing so the number of employees grew to levels of around 850, including 150 apprentices.

Turnover during the period as the Caterpillar dealer grew from around $130m per year in Waugh & Josephson's last year as dealer to a record level of $407m in 2003 for Gough & Gilmour. This growth was largely the result of increased market share in the territory.

New Growth Avenues

When Caterpillar realigned their Australian dealer territories in April 2004, Gough & Gilmour launched a re-shaped business as an independent supplier of low hour Caterpillar machines (to rent or buy), continued quality service, and a new range of genuine Gough & Gilmour parts to suit Caterpillar equipment.  Since then the scope of activities has been removed so that the focus is now on the sale of new parts to suit Caterpillar and other brands of equipment.

Our unique concept of value-adding to fresh chicken is a forerunner in the marketplace. This concept is one our competitors have tried hard to imitate without success.

Founded in Brisbane in 1987, Master Butcher Lenard Poulter identified a niche market for value-added chicken products, tailoring meal solutions to customers' busy lifestyles. It soon became clear that for the continued success of the concept, dedicated management was needed. People who felt as passionately about the business as Lenard did, and had a vested interest in seeing the group grow and succeed. The answer was in franchising. The concept proved so successful that Lenards has now grown to almost 190 stores throughout Australia.

Lenards is a business built from the customers perspective. We are focused on providing top quality service and a rewarding shopping experience for our customers.

Since the first store opened in Queensland in 1987, Lenards has sold more than 400 million chickens, served more than 130 million customers and injected more than $1 billion into the Australian poultry market.
