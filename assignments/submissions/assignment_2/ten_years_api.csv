<jats:italic>Research Summary</jats:italic></jats:title><jats:p>This research addresses firms' use of external knowledge sources to develop patented inventions and explores the validity of patent citations as an indicator of interfirm knowledge flows. By comparing patent citations with primary data reported by the inventors, we uncover systematic measurement errors in patent citations and show that they depend on the firms' patent strategies (e.g., to reduce the risk of imitation or litigation), the source of knowledge employed (e.g., competitors, users), the technology of the underlying invention, and the institutional characteristics of the patent system. Our findings about the role of these factors in external knowledge sourcing and citing propensity highlight the importance of firms' strategic behavior and offer novel insights for the use of patent citations as an indicator of knowledge flows.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>
<jats:italic>Managerial Summary</jats:italic></jats:title><jats:p>Firms' open innovation strategies rely on the sourcing of knowledge from other organizations. Tracing these knowledge flows is difficult, such that the empirical research on this matter typically uses citations that patents make to prior art in order to track them. However, patent citations might be added also for reasons other than the actual transfer of knowledge. We use primary information from a large survey of inventors to assess the accuracy of patent citations to measure knowledge flows, and we find evidence of measurement errors that depend on the applicants' patent strategies, the type of knowledge sources used, the filing jurisdiction, and the technology of the underlying invention. We offer insights to evaluate the settings in which patent citations are a reliable measure of knowledge flows.</jats:p></jats:sec>",2019

While studies of search have established the importance of search breadth, and argued that problems trigger search, they have focused on a single problem source instigating search. We extend prior research by considering how search breadth differs in the presence of proximate and remote problem sources. Because of differences in familiarity with each type of problem, and in expectations of their ability to influence the problem source, problems triggered by remote sources associate with greater breadth. Firms' technological capabilities, meanwhile, temper these findings; capable firms exhibit broader search when facing problems raised by proximate sources. Using data describing the U.S. renewable electricity sector, we generate theoretical and empirical implications.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Managerial Summary</jats:title><jats:p>When facing new problems, firms tend to seek knowledge from various sources to better understand the problem and identify relevant solutions. The source of the problem may be an important trigger to the breadth of search activities, particularly whether the source is proximate or remote. To test this notion, we compare U.S. utility firms' search breadth when facing regulations emphasizing increased renewable generation, from both the federal and the state government. We find that firms tend to search for knowledge about renewable technologies more broadly following federal regulatory actions. However, firms that have previously generated renewable electricity search more broadly following state regulatory actions. By exploring firms' choices in the U.S. renewable electricity sector, our research generates important managerial and public policy implications.</jats:p></jats:sec>",2020

Conventional wisdom suggests that an advantaged firm will do more harm to closer competitors, but the opposite may occur if competitors can reposition themselves. Closer competitors have stronger incentives to reposition away from the advantaged firm, thereby potentially encroaching on rivals more distant from the advantaged firm and propagating the harm to them like the cue ball in billiards transfers energy from cue stick to target ball. Our formal model compares an advantaged firm's closer and farther competitors, when repositioning is allowed or prohibited, and demonstrates when its advantage hurts farther competitors worse than closer ones. We provide an illustrative case study from grocery retailing.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Managerial Summary</jats:title><jats:p>When Walmart brought its advantage in distribution efficiency to the low end of the grocery retailing industry, it displaced the inefficient downscale incumbent Winn‐Dixie in many geographic areas. One might have expected such increased efficiency at the low end of the market to hurt midscale supermarkets like Kroger more than premium grocers like Whole Foods, yet the opposite occurred. Why? In a word, repositioning. Midscale competitors retreated away from Walmart by repositioning upscale via renovations, which thereby transferred the impact to premium rivals who could not escape any further upscale. Our economic model of this “cue‐ball effect” predicts that the impact propagated onto upper‐end competitors is greater in markets with less income inequality, and our empirical results are consistent with this prediction.</jats:p></jats:sec>",2024

However, risk considerations may discourage such candidates from departing high‐paying, stable jobs. Interpreting the manager's decision within a household holding a “portfolio” of jobs, we hypothesize that having a spouse whose career is prioritized mitigates risk as a barrier to joining a startup. Survey data corroborate that both men and women with a career‐prioritized spouse are less likely to report risk as a barrier. However, having a career‐prioritized spouse only translates to a greater interest in startup employment among men. Our findings have implications for understanding the challenges startup ventures face when attracting managerial talent, how dual careers and gender affect managers' careers, and regional entrepreneurial ecosystems.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Managerial Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Using survey data from professional managers working in corporate headquarters, we show that being in a dual‐career household increases one's willingness and lowers the perceived risk of leaving their job and joining a startup venture—especially if the household prioritizes their spouse's career. However, the increased willingness to join a startup in households that prioritize their spouse's career is only manifest for men. These findings highlight how dual‐career households can be a talent source for startup ventures and suggest that regions with greater concentrations of dual‐career households might be especially advantageous for startup ventures. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that gender norms are an impediment for dual‐career women when considering employment in startup ventures.</jats:p></jats:sec>",2023
