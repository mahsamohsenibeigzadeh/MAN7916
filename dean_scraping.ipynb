We were at a table near the entrance listening to a young guitar player entertaining the patrons when Rob Thomas came around the corner. Rob was headlining the Dr. Phillips birthday celebration.\\xa0He grew up in Orlando and is the co-founder of the group Matchbox 20. It’s fair to say that he is a really big deal. Rob looked up at the performer, took out his wallet, put cash into the tip box, nodded and went on his way. The whole encounter lasted about 20 seconds.\\nMy initial reaction was surprise that Rob carried cash, especially since he was clearly headed over to the venue for the evening’s performance.\\xa0But I soon realized that he was remembering where he came from, how tough the journey was, and the value of offering encouragement to the young guitar player to, well, just play on. It was a very cool moment.\\nIt’s easy for those of us who have spent a lifetime in higher education to remember what we were like when we were striving to be college graduates, let alone professors.\\xa0It’s a long, hard and uncertain road to a successful future. Taking time to remember where we came from, the nature of the journey, and throwing something into “the tip jar” for a student trying to walk in our shoes is something we should all do more often.

Everyone fails. It is part of life. Rather than pretend it won’t happen, you should count on it and know what you will do to recover from it. Getting comfortable with failure is a key step in becoming a better risk-taker and successful leader. That is why we celebrate failure and persistence in the college. Entering our competition is simple:\\n\\nWrite an account of a career-related failure you have experienced in the past. Your failure story has to focus on a time you stepped out of your comfort zone to experience something new: the farther you stepped out of your zone, the better. Tell us why this was such a stretch for you, the failure that resulted and what you learned from the experience that would be of interest to others. It needs to be genuine; people can spot a fish story a mile way.\\nWhile the Failure Competition began with students in our Capstone class, it is now open to any UCF student on campus: undergraduate, graduate or EMBA, business, education, engineering or whatever. The only requirement is that you currently be enrolled at UCF.\\nNeed inspiration or guidance to tell your story? Search my blog. We have posted many stories about failure over the years.\\n\\nHere are the ground rules, along with important deadlines:\\nTo enter, you must post your essay in response to this blog. If you are a Capstone student this semester, include your section number and name of your instructor. If you are not in this class, tell me your class standing (e.g., freshman, senior, graduate student) and your field of study. You must complete this exercise by 5 p.m., on Monday, Nov. 4th. Don’t worry if you don’t see your submission posted right away, I have to accept it first.\\nA panel of college staff will choose no more than three finalists for me to consider. I will select three finalists by Monday, Nov.11 at 5 p.m.\\nThe finalists will be asked to submit short videos based on their essays. Those videos must be sent to me by 5 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 21.\\nI will feature one video each day on my blog, starting Dec 2nd. Readers will get a chance to vote for their favorite story and determine the winner Friday, Dec. 6.\\nThe winner will get a letter of recommendation from me along with a $500 prize. Second place will get $300, third place $200.

If you’re not, you have already landed a job, are going to graduate school or have a different priority.\\nFor those of you seeking a job, you have a lot going for you. The unemployment rate is very low. Employers are coming to campus looking to hire, and we have given you many opportunities to build an impressive portfolio of experiences and skills that employers covet.\\nIf you are getting interviews, but not landing the job you want, you need to reconsider how you are approaching your interview. To help you think this through, let me share the main reasons talented people don’t get hired by me…\\n1. The candidate thinks the interview is about them, but it’s really about me. I am looking to hire someone who can solve a problem we have. You need to be the solution to that problem. Talk about how your skills and experiences give you the ability to meet my needs.\\n2. You did not do your homework.\\xa0You cannot adequately address my needs, if you don’t know who we are or what we are trying to accomplish. Also, if you didn’t prepare for something that is obviously important to your future– getting this job, why would I think you would change your behavior and exhibit greater care in carrying out your duties once you got the job?\\n3. You didn’t seem eager about the opportunity. I like to hire people with fire in their bellies… people who are motivated by the challenge I have for them. This fire is very easy to see. People who have it are fully engaged in conversation about the challenges and potential solutions that come with the position. They eat and sleep this stuff and believe in what we are trying to accomplish. If you don’t show this to me in the interview, I have no reason to believe it will show up later.\\n4. You had no questions for me. This leads me to think you need a job, any job. Jobs are what people have when they are looking for money to fuel their real interests– it is just a means to another, more important, end. I’m looking for people who want fulfilling careers, embrace our values, and see the opportunity we have as a way for them to progress in their careers. Such people usually have questions for me about the nature of the work.\\n5. I didn’t learn anything new about you in the interview. Chances are, you aren’t the only person I interviewed for this position. In my world, I usually interview three finalists. I am most likely to remember the person who surprised me by giving me an insight I didn’t expect. All else equal, that’s the person I’m going to hire.\\nAre all hiring officials like me? Frankly, yes. I run a big organization. When people interview with me, they have already passed through several rounds of interviews and have been judged to be technically prepared for the task at hand. That allows me to focus a little more on mindsets, motivation and cultural fit. But all hiring managers want people who do their homework and bring their managers solutions rather than problems. They want people who are “all in” and genuinely enjoy what they are doing. Bringing something new to the organization, only adds to the candidate’s appeal. If you want to get the job, be that candidate.\\nShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterLinkedInMoreRedditLike Loading...\\n\\nRelated', [])\n",

OK, that is a little harsh. More precisely, your friends tend to know the same things and have the same experiences that you do. From an information acquisition perspective, they are redundant.\\nThis tends to be the natural state of affairs because most people befriend people who are just like them. This makes life comfortable, but dull. If you want to have an exciting, challenging, highly successful life, you need to get out of your comfort zone and actively search out people who are different from you. You want to meet people who can expand your knowledge base, introduce you to new experiences and broaden your perspective. Be purposeful about this.\\nI have friends who study the structure of human interactions in the workplace and other settings. It is called social network analysis. They look at who knows who, who people go to when they need information or help and how the patterns of people’s interactions differ. It turns out that people with different types of social networks perform differently at work. In other words, who you know and who and what they know really do matter.\\nFor example, managers with more dispersed networks—people who know more people from different parts of the organization, as well as many people outside the organization, get promoted more quickly and earn more money than managers who tend to only associate with people in their work group. And building a broad network with many casual friends whom you only interact with once in a while tends to be more valuable than focusing on building a network with more frequent interactions involving a close set of friends.\\nWhy? Most innovation is stealing. New ideas are scarce, but many old ideas can be applied in new settings. Lots of innovation comes from taking something that was tried successfully in one setting and adapting it to another or from combining existing things in new ways. The more people you know in different settings, the more likely you are to discover something you can apply in your work. And the broader your social network, the more people who will see your genius in action and spread the word to others that you are a rising star. The result: promotion and higher pay.\\nSo, stop hanging out just with people from your high school or people who have the same major you do or who like the same music you do, and find some people who are as different from you as possible and get to know them. I would especially recommend that you get to know some international students—they have very different experiences and perspectives, many come from emerging markets and given globalization are people you are likely to be doing business with some day. Developing those contacts now will pay off big later.\\nShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterLinkedInMoreRedditLike Loading...\\n\\nRelated', [])\n",

You can’t do them all and when you forgo an option to pursue another you lose the benefit of that second choice.  This is known as your opportunity cost. Hopefully you learned this in an economics course by now.\\nYou should think carefully about these costs when you make choices like going to college, just ask ChatGPT:\\nThe biggest cost of going to college can vary depending on individual circumstances, but for many people, lost earnings and tuition and fees tend to be the most significant.\\n1. Lost Earnings:\\n\\nOverview: While attending college, you’re typically not working full-time, so you miss out on the potential income you could have earned by entering the workforce immediately after high school. Over four years, this lost income can be substantial.\\nImpact: This is particularly significant for those who could have entered a well-paying job directly after high school. The lost wages, compounded over time, can represent a significant financial sacrifice.\\n\\n2. Tuition and Fees:\\n\\nOverview: The direct cost of education, including tuition, fees, textbooks, and other related expenses, can be very high, especially at private institutions or out-of-state public universities.\\nImpact: Many students take on substantial debt to cover these costs, and the burden of student loans can impact financial well-being for years or even decades after graduation.\\n\\nWhich is Bigger?\\n\\nFor many students, tuition and fees represent the largest immediate financial burden, especially if they rely on student loans. However, lost earnings can also be a significant cost, particularly when considering the long-term financial implications.\\n\\nThe total cost of attending college, including both direct expenses and lost earnings, needs to be weighed against the potential long-term benefits, such as higher future earnings and career opportunities.\\nWhether opportunity costs exceed the cost of tuition and fees for a student is a complex calculation, but the choices you make can also impact this calculus.  One is the instituion you attend: UCF has one of the lowest tuition and fees in the country.  These costs for our students are small compared to most schools. But you can also reduce your opportunity costs, by graduating as quickly as you can. The shorter your time to graduation, the quicker you start reaping the benefits of your degree: a higher salary, better job conditions, and less student debt.\\nThe bottom line is: Graduating in four years is smart.  Do it if you can.\\n\\n\\nShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterLinkedInMoreRedditLike Loading...\\n\\nRelated', [])\n",

Everybody wants to help a deserving student looking to make a name for their self in the world. Think about it: People donate money for scholarships so that worthy students can realize their dreams. They volunteer to come speak to classes as a way of “giving back” to their community. And who doesn’t find it flattering to be asked by some humble (not pushy) youngster to give them advice on how they can grow up to be just like you someday? \\nYou need to take advantage of your cute and cuddliness now because it will not last long. You stop being cute and cuddly the day you graduate. On that day, you become the competition. The number of people willing to provide you with their time and insight will drop dramatically. So, now is the time to start to develop your networking skills and execute a plan to meet the kinds of people who can provide you with good advice about how to jump-start your career. The earlier you develop this plan and the faster you can execute it, and the bigger the gains you will realize from it. \\nFortunately, the College provides you with a variety of ways to connect with experienced people who can give you advice on what it is like to work in their profession, what choices they made that helped them along the way, how they learned from their mistakes and what you need to do now to be successful later. So, in developing and implementing your plan, some things to do include: \\nGet to know some of your professors outside the classroom by attending office hours and asking their advice. I know they seem like strange creatures, but they are high achievers who know a great deal about what they research. They love talking about what they do, have seen lots of students over the years and have strong opinions about what makes people successful. Many also have professional connections in the community and can help you meet people you want to meet. \\nJoin one of the student organizations in the College. Do this as a freshman and remain active all four years. Almost every major has a student organization. These organizations tend to focus on career development and frequently have guest speakers from the community who talk about the profession and what it takes to succeed. Go to these meetings, ask the guest speaker questions, and mingle before and after the event. Leaving a good impression with a guest speaker might even bring an internship or a job. \\nThe Exchange was created to make meeting people who can help you jump-start your career.\\xa0The alums, community leaders and business professionals who speak in The Exchange can tell you all about what they do, how their company competes, or their organization collaborates, what they are looking for in new recruits and what you need to do now so you will be of interest to them when you are ready to graduate. \\nIn your junior year, apply to be a part of the College’s mentoring program. Just last Thursday, we had 75 volunteer mentors come to campus to meet with students eager to find someone who could give them the right kind of advice.\\xa0If you missed this event, don’t worry we hold it every semester. \\nFinally, when doing these things, ask the people you meet to identify other people you may want to get to know to help you navigate your career. This will likely open even more doors. If this sounds like a fair bit of work, it is—but the payoff will be large. So, get busy. Remember your parents want you to graduate soon, so being cute and cuddly won’t last very long. \\nShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterLinkedInMoreRedditLike Loading...\\n\\nRelated', [])\n",

One of my grandfathers worked in an iron mine, the other in\\xa0a foundry. My father painted houses. My mother kept the books for an oil delivery company.\\xa0For people who suffered through the Great Depression and World War II, they were happy to have honest work. They did their jobs with enormous pride and a sense of accomplishment. Labor Day was a big day in my house. Management, my family joked, got the other 364. (As Dean, I live by this.)\\nSometimes my industry goes out of its way to disparage honest work. We don’t do it directly. We are far too civilized for that.\\xa0Instead, we portray a college education as the gateway to a “better future,” earning the degree holder higher wages and fewer bouts of unemployment than people without the degree. Although it’s never really said, the inference is that honest work is inferior work. Life without college is by definition a lesser future.\\nI beg to differ. Honest work done with your hands and heart, isn’t inferior work, its different work. For some people, it’s the right work. Even today, the U.S. has about 30 million jobs that pay an average of $55,000 or more per year and don’t require a Bachelor’s degree.

I had another who chain smoked, rarely made eye contact, and carefully scripted his lectures because he didn’t feel completely comfortable in front of groups.\\nIf faculty seem like unusual creatures, maybe it is because we have such unusual expectations of them. Here’s the deal: You have six years to prove that you have many new interesting observations backed up by data that students want to hear, editors want to publish, and colleagues want to read so that they can learn from you. There are only two outcomes after six years: unemployment or promotion with a job for life. If you make the first cut, we are going to ask you to be even more interesting and secure a national reputation. If you achieve this distinction, we promote you again. By the way, the average project takes more than two years to complete. Eighty-five to 90 percent of papers professors submit for publication are rejected. Students expect you to be on the top of your game every class. If you need help, call. Otherwise get busy. Time is ticking.\\nThat is your professor’s world and understanding it can help you get the most out of your time at UCF. Faculty aren’t so much professional teachers as they are professional learners. It is what motivates them, and it is what they value most in others. This distinction is not meant to excuse poor classroom performance, but if you want to impress a professor, demonstrate that you are eager to learn — a process where you are an active partner in discovery rather than expecting them to “teach.” It is a subtle distinction but an important one. Faculty hate it when they believe they are “spoon-feeding” students — pouring information into passive, empty heads. Questions like “Is this going to be on the test?” drive them insane. Ask it and they will dismiss you as a lazy student not worthy of their time.\\nTime is a faculty member’s most valuable asset. A professor has just six years to make a name in a world that is hard to impress. That includes the time they are in class with you. Students are a professor’s legacy. The more successful students a professor has the better their reputation. But class time is short, and by necessity, focuses on the things that matter most to student success. Not everything a faculty member says is golden, but the answer to the question, “Did I miss anything important when I skipped class?” — will always be yes.\\nSo now you’re thinking maybe the best strategy is to hide in the back and try not to say the wrong thing. A popular, but bad, idea. You came here to learn, and the best education happens in those moments you get to sit on a log with a professor and talk one-on-one. So go to office hours, especially when it is not right before a test or assignment is due. Getting to know a professor is a bit like being on a blind date — prepare, ask good questions and listen. The best professors I had gave me new perspectives that changed the way I viewed the world. They devoted their lives to the study of a subject they believed was important and wanted to share their insights with anyone who would strike up a conversation. In sharing their ideas, they hoped to change the world. It should not surprise us that unique perspectives come from unique individuals. You don’t have to wear Birkenstocks, or chain-smoke. Just engage, appreciate the insight and put it to good use.\\nShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterLinkedInMoreRedditLike Loading...\\n\\nRelated', [])\n"

Rob was headlining the Dr. Phillips birthday celebration.\\xa0He grew up in Orlando and is the co-founder of the group Matchbox 20. It’s fair to say that he is a really big deal. Rob looked up at the performer, took out his wallet, put cash into the tip box, nodded and went on his way. The whole encounter lasted about 20 seconds.\\nMy initial reaction was surprise that Rob carried cash, especially since he was clearly headed over to the venue for the evening’s performance.\\xa0But I soon realized that he was remembering where he came from, how tough the journey was, and the value of offering encouragement to the young guitar player to, well, just play on. It was a very cool moment.\\nIt’s easy for those of us who have spent a lifetime in higher education to remember what we were like when we were striving to be college graduates, let alone professors.\\xa0It’s a long, hard and uncertain road to a successful future. Taking time to remember where we came from, the nature of the journey, and throwing something into “the tip jar” for a student trying to walk in our shoes is something we should all do more often.

Everyone fails. It is part of life. Rather than pretend it won’t happen, you should count on it and know what you will do to recover from it. Getting comfortable with failure is a key step in becoming a better risk-taker and successful leader. That is why we celebrate failure and persistence in the college. Entering our competition is simple:\\n\\nWrite an account of a career-related failure you have experienced in the past. Your failure story has to focus on a time you stepped out of your comfort zone to experience something new: the farther you stepped out of your zone, the better. Tell us why this was such a stretch for you, the failure that resulted and what you learned from the experience that would be of interest to others. It needs to be genuine; people can spot a fish story a mile way.\\nWhile the Failure Competition began with students in our Capstone class, it is now open to any UCF student on campus: undergraduate, graduate or EMBA, business, education, engineering or whatever. The only requirement is that you currently be enrolled at UCF.\\nNeed inspiration or guidance to tell your story? Search my blog. We have posted many stories about failure over the years.\\n\\nHere are the ground rules, along with important deadlines:\\nTo enter, you must post your essay in response to this blog. If you are a Capstone student this semester, include your section number and name of your instructor. If you are not in this class, tell me your class standing (e.g., freshman, senior, graduate student) and your field of study. You must complete this exercise by 5 p.m., on Monday, Nov. 4th. Don’t worry if you don’t see your submission posted right away, I have to accept it first.\\nA panel of college staff will choose no more than three finalists for me to consider. I will select three finalists by Monday, Nov.11 at 5 p.m.\\nThe finalists will be asked to submit short videos based on their essays. Those videos must be sent to me by 5 p.m. on Friday, Nov. 21.\\nI will feature one video each day on my blog, starting Dec 2nd. Readers will get a chance to vote for their favorite story and determine the winner Friday, Dec. 6.\\nThe winner will get a letter of recommendation from me along with a $500 prize.

If you’re not, you have already landed a job, are going to graduate school or have a different priority.\\nFor those of you seeking a job, you have a lot going for you. The unemployment rate is very low. Employers are coming to campus looking to hire, and we have given you many opportunities to build an impressive portfolio of experiences and skills that employers covet.\\nIf you are getting interviews, but not landing the job you want, you need to reconsider how you are approaching your interview. To help you think this through, let me share the main reasons talented people don’t get hired by me…\\n1. The candidate thinks the interview is about them, but it’s really about me. I am looking to hire someone who can solve a problem we have. You need to be the solution to that problem. Talk about how your skills and experiences give you the ability to meet my needs.\\n2. You did not do your homework.\\xa0You cannot adequately address my needs, if you don’t know who we are or what we are trying to accomplish. Also, if you didn’t prepare for something that is obviously important to your future– getting this job, why would I think you would change your behavior and exhibit greater care in carrying out your duties once you got the job?\\n3. You didn’t seem eager about the opportunity. I like to hire people with fire in their bellies… people who are motivated by the challenge I have for them. This fire is very easy to see. People who have it are fully engaged in conversation about the challenges and potential solutions that come with the position. They eat and sleep this stuff and believe in what we are trying to accomplish. If you don’t show this to me in the interview, I have no reason to believe it will show up later.\\n4. You had no questions for me. This leads me to think you need a job, any job. Jobs are what people have when they are looking for money to fuel their real interests– it is just a means to another, more important, end. I’m looking for people who want fulfilling careers, embrace our values, and see the opportunity we have as a way for them to progress in their careers. Such people usually have questions for me about the nature of the work.\\n5. I didn’t learn anything new about you in the interview. Chances are, you aren’t the only person I interviewed for this position. In my world, I usually interview three finalists. I am most likely to remember the person who surprised me by giving me an insight I didn’t expect. All else equal, that’s the person I’m going to hire.\\nAre all hiring officials like me? Frankly, yes. I run a big organization. When people interview with me, they have already passed through several rounds of interviews and have been judged to be technically prepared for the task at hand. That allows me to focus a little more on mindsets, motivation and cultural fit. But all hiring managers want people who do their homework and bring their managers solutions rather than problems. They want people who are “all in” and genuinely enjoy what they are doing. Bringing something new to the organization, only adds to the candidate’s appeal. If you want to get the job, be that candidate.\\nShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterLinkedInMoreRedditLike Loading...\\n\\nRelated', [])\n",

OK, that is a little harsh. More precisely, your friends tend to know the same things and have the same experiences that you do. From an information acquisition perspective, they are redundant.\\nThis tends to be the natural state of affairs because most people befriend people who are just like them. This makes life comfortable, but dull. If you want to have an exciting, challenging, highly successful life, you need to get out of your comfort zone and actively search out people who are different from you. You want to meet people who can expand your knowledge base, introduce you to new experiences and broaden your perspective. Be purposeful about this.\\nI have friends who study the structure of human interactions in the workplace and other settings. It is called social network analysis. They look at who knows who, who people go to when they need information or help and how the patterns of people’s interactions differ. It turns out that people with different types of social networks perform differently at work. In other words, who you know and who and what they know really do matter.\\nFor example, managers with more dispersed networks—people who know more people from different parts of the organization, as well as many people outside the organization, get promoted more quickly and earn more money than managers who tend to only associate with people in their work group. And building a broad network with many casual friends whom you only interact with once in a while tends to be more valuable than focusing on building a network with more frequent interactions involving a close set of friends.\\nWhy? Most innovation is stealing. New ideas are scarce, but many old ideas can be applied in new settings. Lots of innovation comes from taking something that was tried successfully in one setting and adapting it to another or from combining existing things in new ways. The more people you know in different settings, the more likely you are to discover something you can apply in your work. And the broader your social network, the more people who will see your genius in action and spread the word to others that you are a rising star. The result: promotion and higher pay.\\nSo, stop hanging out just with people from your high school or people who have the same major you do or who like the same music you do, and find some people who are as different from you as possible and get to know them. I would especially recommend that you get to know some international students—they have very different experiences and perspectives, many come from emerging markets and given globalization are people you are likely to be doing business with some day. Developing those contacts now will pay off big later.\\nShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterLinkedInMoreRedditLike Loading...\\n\\nRelated', [])\n",

You can’t do them all and when you forgo an option to pursue another you lose the benefit of that second choice.  This is known as your opportunity cost. Hopefully you learned this in an economics course by now.\\nYou should think carefully about these costs when you make choices like going to college, just ask ChatGPT:\\nThe biggest cost of going to college can vary depending on individual circumstances, but for many people, lost earnings and tuition and fees tend to be the most significant.\\n1. Lost Earnings:\\n\\nOverview: While attending college, you’re typically not working full-time, so you miss out on the potential income you could have earned by entering the workforce immediately after high school. Over four years, this lost income can be substantial.\\nImpact: This is particularly significant for those who could have entered a well-paying job directly after high school. The lost wages, compounded over time, can represent a significant financial sacrifice.\\n\\n2. Tuition and Fees:\\n\\nOverview: The direct cost of education, including tuition, fees, textbooks, and other related expenses, can be very high, especially at private institutions or out-of-state public universities.\\nImpact: Many students take on substantial debt to cover these costs, and the burden of student loans can impact financial well-being for years or even decades after graduation.\\n\\nWhich is Bigger?\\n\\nFor many students, tuition and fees represent the largest immediate financial burden, especially if they rely on student loans. However, lost earnings can also be a significant cost, particularly when considering the long-term financial implications.\\n\\nThe total cost of attending college, including both direct expenses and lost earnings, needs to be weighed against the potential long-term benefits, such as higher future earnings and career opportunities.\\nWhether opportunity costs exceed the cost of tuition and fees for a student is a complex calculation, but the choices you make can also impact this calculus.  One is the instituion you attend: UCF has one of the lowest tuition and fees in the country.  These costs for our students are small compared to most schools. But you can also reduce your opportunity costs, by graduating as quickly as you can. The shorter your time to graduation, the quicker you start reaping the benefits of your degree: a higher salary, better job conditions, and less student debt.\\nThe bottom line is: Graduating in four years is smart.

Everybody wants to help a deserving student looking to make a name for their self in the world. Think about it: People donate money for scholarships so that worthy students can realize their dreams. They volunteer to come speak to classes as a way of “giving back” to their community. And who doesn’t find it flattering to be asked by some humble (not pushy) youngster to give them advice on how they can grow up to be just like you someday? \\nYou need to take advantage of your cute and cuddliness now because it will not last long. You stop being cute and cuddly the day you graduate. On that day, you become the competition. The number of people willing to provide you with their time and insight will drop dramatically. So, now is the time to start to develop your networking skills and execute a plan to meet the kinds of people who can provide you with good advice about how to jump-start your career. The earlier you develop this plan and the faster you can execute it, and the bigger the gains you will realize from it. \\nFortunately, the College provides you with a variety of ways to connect with experienced people who can give you advice on what it is like to work in their profession, what choices they made that helped them along the way, how they learned from their mistakes and what you need to do now to be successful later. So, in developing and implementing your plan, some things to do include: \\nGet to know some of your professors outside the classroom by attending office hours and asking their advice. I know they seem like strange creatures, but they are high achievers who know a great deal about what they research. They love talking about what they do, have seen lots of students over the years and have strong opinions about what makes people successful. Many also have professional connections in the community and can help you meet people you want to meet. \\nJoin one of the student organizations in the College. Do this as a freshman and remain active all four years. Almost every major has a student organization. These organizations tend to focus on career development and frequently have guest speakers from the community who talk about the profession and what it takes to succeed. Go to these meetings, ask the guest speaker questions, and mingle before and after the event. Leaving a good impression with a guest speaker might even bring an internship or a job. \\nThe Exchange was created to make meeting people who can help you jump-start your career.\\xa0The alums, community leaders and business professionals who speak in The Exchange can tell you all about what they do, how their company competes, or their organization collaborates, what they are looking for in new recruits and what you need to do now so you will be of interest to them when you are ready to graduate. \\nIn your junior year, apply to be a part of the College’s mentoring program. Just last Thursday, we had 75 volunteer mentors come to campus to meet with students eager to find someone who could give them the right kind of advice.\\xa0If you missed this event, don’t worry we hold it every semester. \\nFinally, when doing these things, ask the people you meet to identify other people you may want to get to know to help you navigate your career. This will likely open even more doors. If this sounds like a fair bit of work, it is—but the payoff will be large. So, get busy. Remember your parents want you to graduate soon, so being cute and cuddly won’t last very long. \\nShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterLinkedInMoreRedditLike Loading...\\n\\nRelated', [])\n",

Here’s the deal: You have six years to prove that you have many new interesting observations backed up by data that students want to hear, editors want to publish, and colleagues want to read so that they can learn from you. There are only two outcomes after six years: unemployment or promotion with a job for life. If you make the first cut, we are going to ask you to be even more interesting and secure a national reputation. If you achieve this distinction, we promote you again. By the way, the average project takes more than two years to complete. Eighty-five to 90 percent of papers professors submit for publication are rejected. Students expect you to be on the top of your game every class. If you need help, call. Otherwise get busy. Time is ticking.\\nThat is your professor’s world and understanding it can help you get the most out of your time at UCF. Faculty aren’t so much professional teachers as they are professional learners. It is what motivates them, and it is what they value most in others. This distinction is not meant to excuse poor classroom performance, but if you want to impress a professor, demonstrate that you are eager to learn — a process where you are an active partner in discovery rather than expecting them to “teach.” It is a subtle distinction but an important one. Faculty hate it when they believe they are “spoon-feeding” students — pouring information into passive, empty heads. Questions like “Is this going to be on the test?” drive them insane. Ask it and they will dismiss you as a lazy student not worthy of their time.\\nTime is a faculty member’s most valuable asset. A professor has just six years to make a name in a world that is hard to impress. That includes the time they are in class with you. Students are a professor’s legacy. The more successful students a professor has the better their reputation. But class time is short, and by necessity, focuses on the things that matter most to student success. Not everything a faculty member says is golden, but the answer to the question, “Did I miss anything important when I skipped class?” — will always be yes.\\nSo now you’re thinking maybe the best strategy is to hide in the back and try not to say the wrong thing. A popular, but bad, idea. You came here to learn, and the best education happens in those moments you get to sit on a log with a professor and talk one-on-one. So go to office hours, especially when it is not right before a test or assignment is due. Getting to know a professor is a bit like being on a blind date — prepare, ask good questions and listen. The best professors I had gave me new perspectives that changed the way I viewed the world. They devoted their lives to the study of a subject they believed was important and wanted to share their insights with anyone who would strike up a conversation. In sharing their ideas, they hoped to change the world. It should not surprise us that unique perspectives come from unique individuals. You don’t have to wear Birkenstocks, or chain-smoke. Just engage, appreciate the insight and put it to good use.\\nShare this:EmailPrintFacebookTwitterLinkedInMoreRedditLike Loading...\\n\\nRelated', [])\n"
